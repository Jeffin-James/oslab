1. FIND THE GREATEST NUMBERS
PROGRAM: 
echo “Enter 2 numbers”
read a b
if [ $a –gt $b ] 
then
echo “$a is greater”
else
echo “$b is greater”
fi
Output:
Enter 2 numbers
5     9
9 is greater
2. SUM OF N NUMBERS:
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter limit"
read n
i=1
sum=0
while [ $i -le $n ]
do
let sum=$sum+$i
let i=$i+1
done
echo "The sum of $n numbers is $sum"
Output:
Enter limit
5
The sum of 5 numbers is 15
3. SWAPPING OF TWO NUMBERS:
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter two numbers"
read a b
t=$a
a=$b
b=$t
echo "a=$a b=$b"
Output:
Enter two numbers
2     4
a=4     b=2
4. CHECKING THE NUMBER IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE:
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter a number"
read a
if [ $a -ge 0 ]
then
echo "$a is positive"
else
echo "$a is negative"
fi
Output:
Enter a number
-8
-8 is negative
Enter a number
4
4 is positive
5. GREATEST OF THREE NUMBERS:
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter three numbers"
read a b c
if [ $a -gt $b -a $a -gt $c ]
then
echo "$a is greatest"
elif [ $b -gt $a -a $b -gt $c ]
then
echo "$b is greatest"
else
echo "$c is greatest"
fi
Output:
Enter three numbers
9 1 6
9 is greatest
6. FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER:
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter the limit"
read n
i=1
fact=1
while [ $i -le $n ]
do
let fact=$fact\*$i
let i=$i+1
done
echo "Factorial of $n is $fact"
Output:
Enter the limit
5
Factorial of 5 is 120
7. CHECK WHETHER A NUMBER IS PRIME OR NOT:
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter the number"
read n
x=0
for (( i=2; i<n; i++ ))
do
let s=$n%$i
if [ $s -eq 0 ]
then
x=1
break
fi
done
if [ $x -eq 1 ]
then
echo "$n is not a prime number"
else
echo "$n is a prime number"
fi
Output:
Enter the number
97
97 is a prime number
Enter the number
66
66 is not a prime number
